Per the design posted on issue #99 on Github there are a few things that need to be changed

New logo - added
Social media icon theme color - added
Social media icons moving to the footer on mobile view
The navbar link :hover should be yellow on both top and bottom navbar
Donate button
    needs a higher border radius
    needs to be centered with a custom margin class instead of bootstrap classes (currently mt-4) 
There's a shopping cart icon next to the donate button
    The are no details on how this is being implemented in the site
    I'm thinking for this we'll have to create a new Col and squeeze it in there with the different screen sizes 
Other components interfereing with responsiveness 
    Fix it temporarily and talk to the other team about fixing it or fix it permanently and have them pull the changes?
