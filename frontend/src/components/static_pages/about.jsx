            <p className="text-left">
              The Young Masterbuilders in Motion (YMIM) inspires, connects, and
              empowers young women orphans, adoptees, and foster youth alumnae
              to thrive.
            </p>

            <p className="text-left">
              The YMIM provides a holistic approach to mentoring and leadership
              development. Our programs are delivered through empowerment
              workshops, life enrichment retreats, and international missions
              experiences.
            </p>

            <h2 className="sub-heading"> Our Values </h2>

            <p className="text-left">
              We believe that a caring and supportive community can equip young
              women and empower global communities.
            </p>

            <p className="text-left">
              We whole-heartedly embrace peace, grace, joy, love and wisdom and
              want to share what we have learned in our wide and varied life
              experiences with those who are yet vulnerable and who desire such
              support.
            </p>

            <h2 className="sub-heading">Our Approach to Engagement</h2>

            <p className="text-left">
              The YMIM works to enhance participants’ global perspective of the
              world economy. Through access and exposure to the arts, healthcare
              advocacy, sciences, technology, industries, and international
              mission experiences we aim to enrich the cultural, personal, and
              professional aspects of each participant.
            </p>

            <p className="text-left">
              We listen to participants, address their concerns, and help
              connect them with resources to navigate life. We help participants
              develop life skills necessary to thrive as the masterbuilder of
              their future.
            </p>

            <p className="text-left">
              Our approach includes models and scenarios of self-direction that
              cover a broad span on topics of visioning life goals, decision
              making, and self-sufficiency. Additionally, we help participants
              mature in accountability and leadership through peer-to-peer
              mentoring and workshops on the precepts and concepts of
              entrepreneurship, sustained employment, global community service
              activities and more. **Our Road to Impactful Programming** Alumnae
              input and feedback are the drivers of ongoing program
              enhancements. Our pre and post self assessments provide our
              guideposts to impactful programming. Participants of each age
              segment serve on ideation and planning committees.
              Participant-centered needs is how we determine where to prioritize
              cultural, education, life skills, and employment programming. 
              **Resources and Referrals** We link participants to resources and
              services beyond our capacity for those desiring or requiring
              additional support.

                Wright grew up as a youth-in-care from age 2 to 17 in multiple
                foster homes and a catholic orphanage after losing her mother to
                a premature death due to a horrific domestic violence incident.
                At the age of 7, Wright knew then that her life’s path would
                lead her serve children and young people who also grew up
                without the care and guidance of their own loving mother or
                father. Lacking mentors and relatives to share their experiences
                on how they made it and how she could too, caused Wright to
                always read and research how to do anything. Wright has worked
                as a reporter, writer, editor, HR manager, trainer, case
                manager, and director. Finally stepping out on faith to do what
                she had in her heart since age 7, Wright quotes Audrey Lorde,
                “When I dare to be powerful—to use my strength in the service of
                my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am
                afraid.”
