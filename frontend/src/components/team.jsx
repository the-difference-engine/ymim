                <p>A message to all the girls and young women who feel that you don’t quite fit in anywhere:</p>
                <p>One day you might consider it a blessing…</p>
                <p>Maybe you are destined to stand up and stand out, and that all of your misfitedness was preparing you for a future as a change agent.</p>
                <p>As a child in foster care since the age of two, I grew up learning about God and embracing people from diverse cultures and backgrounds. My first foster family was kind, compassionate and worked to serve the needs of the community.</p>
                <p>During the era of my youth, I remember the saying that children were seen and not heard. However, I was quite the naive child, quiet, and observant of whatever was going on around me. I was also bold enough to speak my thoughts on whatever topic I thought I should weigh in on. From time to time, I must add, that courage to speak my mind did cost me. However, in the long run, the penalty and punishments caused me to become determined to fight for justice in my own way.</p>
                <p>At times I was brave, yet other times I grew very afraid. I felt alone, yet I was surrounded by people of all ages. I was not harmed like many of my sisters and brothers in the foster care system; yet I was ill-equipped to move through life like most young people do, in a common, natural sense of awkwardness.</p>
                <p>I remember the opportunities where glimpses of other peoples’ lives showed me how life was for regular people. Those who belonged, who had roots, had a family, a backbone, a tightly weaved fabric that they easily and seamlessly blended into. I appreciated those moments of clarity and vision and I wondered what my future life would behold.</p>
                <p>Over the years I have met the challenge of new experiences of my becoming. Day by day, swallow by swallow I found my voice getting stronger. Each year that would go by, I found that action, reaction or inaction is a choice. Deciding how to get the best out of each decision is the key to making good choices.</p>
                <p>I have learned that it is important to find people with whom I could give and get support. You too will one day crawl through the muddy waters of life. You will even need to leap with grace over ragged rocks in the raging lakes or seas. Just remember to look to the heavens while scaling your mountains and believe, if you will, that God will see you through. Be determined and committed to your personal success. And, if you do pursue your best self in whatever form that it takes, I believe it will bring out the best in all of us.</p>
                <p>My mantra…</p>
                <p>“When I dare to be powerful — to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid.”&nbsp;</p>
                <p>-Audre Lorde</p>
                <p>My personal belief…</p>
                <p>“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”</p>
                <p>-Nelson Mandela</p>
                <p>I also believe that education comes in the form of mentors, life lessons, mistakes, books, school, comedy, films, cultural experiences, love, disappointments, and more. Being resilient and able to overcome the challenges that life offers, is where we become our own champions. Pain moves us into action if we allow it to take us where we need to go. We have a choice. Let’s chase after life to learn more, live well, and love more.</p>
                <p>In service,</p>
